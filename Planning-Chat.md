Looking at this comprehensive spec, I can help you break this down into manageable tasks that fit within a 5-hour timeframe. Given the scope, I suggest focusing on the foundation first: the Lightroom API integration and admin interface, as you mentioned.

Here's my recommended approach, broken into prompt-friendly tasks:

## Phase 1: Foundation (1.5 hours)
### Task 1.1: Project Setup (30 min) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```
Create a new Astro project with Cloudflare Workers support:
- Initialize Astro with @astrojs/cloudflare adapter ‚úÖ
- Set up basic wrangler.toml with KV namespaces and R2 bucket bindings ‚úÖ
- Create environment variables structure for ADOBE_CLIENT_ID, ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET, ADMIN_PASSWORD ‚úÖ
- Set up a basic routing structure with /admin and /api routes ‚úÖ
- Create a simple test to verify the Worker deploys locally ‚úÖ
```

**Progress Notes:**
- Successfully set up Astro with Cloudflare Workers (advanced mode)
- Configured wrangler.toml with specific KV namespace IDs provided by user
- Deployed to production at dev.seaofclouds.com with custom domain
- Fixed Worker vs Pages mode issue (must use advanced mode)

### Task 1.2: Data Models & Storage Setup (30 min) ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```
Create TypeScript interfaces and storage utilities based on the spec:
- Define interfaces for Album, Asset, Rendition, and Flags ‚úÖ
- Create R2 helper functions for read/write operations with path conventions ‚úÖ
- Create KV helper functions for flags, slugs, and sync state ‚úÖ
- Implement a DataSource abstraction with 'test' and 'lightroom' modes ‚úÖ
- Add test data generator using Lorem Picsum for local development ‚úÖ
```

**Progress Notes:**
- Created comprehensive storage abstractions (R2Storage and KVStorage classes)
- Implemented DataSource interface with TestDataSource generating 13 realistic albums
- Albums include all 4 Lightroom subtypes: collection, collection_set, smart, topic
- Integrated Lorem Picsum with deterministic seeds for consistent test images
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for all data models

### Task 1.3: Authentication Scaffold (30 min) ‚úÖ COMPLETED AND ENHANCED
```
Implement basic authentication for admin routes:
- Create middleware to check ADMIN_PASSWORD for local dev ‚úÖ
- Add session management using KV for admin sessions ‚úÖ
- Create /admin/auth/login endpoint with simple form ‚úÖ
- Protect all /admin/* routes with auth middleware ‚úÖ
- Add logout functionality ‚úÖ
```

**Progress Notes - Significantly Exceeded Expectations:**
- **FULL Adobe OAuth Integration**: Complete IMS authentication system
- **Dual Environment Support**: 
  - Production: Adobe OAuth with KV token storage
  - Development: Adobe OAuth with shared memory token storage
- **Complete Authentication Flow**:
  - `/admin/auth/login` - OAuth initiation (redirects to Adobe)
  - `/admin/auth/callback` - OAuth callback handler with token exchange
  - `/admin/auth/logout` - Token revocation + redirect to root domain
- **Token Management**: Automatic refresh, proper expiration handling
- **Development Optimizations**: Shared memory storage eliminates KV dependency
- **Successfully Tested**: End-to-end OAuth flow working in development with HTTPS
- **Critical Fixes Applied**:
  - Shared memory token persistence across Worker instances
  - Proper storage initialization for development environment
  - Adobe redirect URI configuration for localhost
  - Complete logout with token revocation and storage clearing

## Phase 2: Lightroom API Integration (1.5 hours)
### Task 2.1: API Client (45 min) üî® IN PROGRESS - NOT TESTED
```
Create a Lightroom API client with proper error handling:
- Implement OAuth token management (store/refresh in KV) ‚úÖ BUILT
- Create paginated fetch wrapper with exponential backoff for 429s ‚ùì BUILT BUT NOT TESTED
- Add methods for: listAlbums(collectionSetId), getAlbum(albumId), getAsset(assetId) ‚ùì BUILT BUT NOT TESTED
- Implement cursor-based pagination handling ‚ùì BUILT BUT NOT TESTED
- Add rate limiting with KV-based counters ‚ùì BUILT BUT NOT TESTED
```

**Actual Status:**
- Created LightroomApiClient class with methods - NOT TESTED with real API
- OAuth token management exists in auth.ts - TESTED & WORKING
- Rate limiting code written - NOT TESTED
- Exponential backoff code written - NOT TESTED
- No actual API calls have been made yet to Lightroom

### Task 2.2: Sync Engine (45 min)
```
Build the core sync functionality:
- Create a sync job that fetches albums from collection_set: 07ba0fcb09714671bc71ab7ba5a091e7
- Store album metadata in R2 at /albums/metadata.json
- Implement publish flow: when album marked public, fetch full details and assets
- Add rendition downloading (640, 1280, 2048) with R2 storage
- Store sync state and cursors in KV for resumability
```

## Phase 3: Admin UI (1.5 hours)
### Task 3.1: Album List Interface (45 min)
```
Create the admin dashboard at /admin:
- Build a collapsible tree view for albums (client-side state)
- Add publish/unpublish toggle buttons that update KV flags
- Implement client-side search/filter for album names
- Show sync status and last updated times
- Add "Sync Now" button to trigger manual sync
```

### Task 3.2: Album Detail View (45 min)
```
Create album management features:
- Build /admin/albums/:id route showing album details
- Display thumbnail grid of assets in the album
- Add slug configuration with auto-generation and collision handling
- Show publish status and allow toggling
- Display sync errors or warnings if any
```

## Phase 4: Public Site Implementation (1 hour)
### Task 4.1: Public Album Routes (30 min)
```
Implement public-facing album viewing:
- Create [slug].astro for /:slug album pages with KV slug resolution
- Add /albums/:id route for direct ID access
- Implement R2 metadata fetching with ETag support
- Add fallback to last-good JSON if sync fails
- Test slug resolution and album rendering
```

### Task 4.2: Public Site Layout & UX (30 min)
```
Build public gallery experience:
- Implement CSS Grid tiled layout (auto-fit, minmax, no fixed heights)
- Add semantic HTML: <figure><img><figcaption> structure
- Create responsive image serving with srcset/sizes
- Add basic right-click deterrents (context menu disable, drag prevention)
- Test mobile responsiveness and touch targets (‚â•44px)
```

## Suggested Implementation Order:

1. **Start with Task 1.1** - Get the basic project structure running
2. **Then Task 1.2** - Set up your data models and storage patterns
3. **Jump to Task 2.1** - Get the Lightroom API client working (this is critical path)
4. **Do Task 1.3** - Add basic auth so you can protect the admin
5. **Complete Task 3.1** - Build a minimal admin UI to see your data
6. **Implement Task 2.2** - Add the sync engine to populate R2
7. **If time permits, do Task 3.2 and 4.1**

## Implementation Notes:

### **Completed Beyond Original Scope:**
1. **Full Adobe OAuth** - Complete IMS integration (not just ADMIN_PASSWORD)
2. **Production Deployment** - Working at dev.seaofclouds.com
3. **Enhanced Authentication** - Dual environment support with proper token management

### **Future Enhancements:**
1. **Webhook Support** - Adobe I/O Events for automatic sync
2. **Enhanced UI** - More sophisticated admin interface styling
3. **Full Renditions** - Include 2560 and fullsize (currently 640, 1280, 2048)
4. **Slug Collision Handling** - Automatic "-2", "-3" suffixing
5. **Featured Albums** - Enhanced flag system beyond public/private
6. **Rate Limit UI** - Visual feedback in admin interface
7. **Staging Environment** - Three-tier deployment with limited album slice
8. **Asset Domain** - assets.seaofclouds.com CDN setup

## First Prompt to Start:

```
Create a new Astro project with Cloudflare Workers support. Set up the project structure with:
- @astrojs/cloudflare adapter configured
- Basic wrangler.toml with KV namespaces (ADOBE_TOKENS, RATE_LIMITS) and R2 bucket (ASSETS)
- Environment variables for ADOBE_CLIENT_ID, ADOBE_CLIENT_SECRET, ADMIN_PASSWORD
- Routes for /, /admin, /api
- A simple test page at /admin that says "Admin Dashboard" to verify auth will work
- TypeScript configured with interfaces for Album, Asset, and Rendition types
```

## Current Status (Updated)

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS:
- **Task 1.1, 1.2, 1.3**: Foundation complete with full Adobe OAuth
- **Authentication Middleware**: All `/admin/*` routes now properly protected
- **API Route Consolidation**: Moved all APIs under `/admin/api/*` (no public APIs)
- **Production Deployment**: Working at `dev.seaofclouds.com` with Adobe OAuth

### üî® CURRENT FOCUS: Sync System Enhancement

**Plan**: Enhance `sync-fresh.ts` incrementally rather than using complex `sync-metadata.ts`

**Enhancement Roadmap for `sync-fresh.ts`:**

**Phase 1: Core Improvements**
1. **Pagination Logic** - Add cursor-based pagination 
2. **Collection Set Support** - Add `collection_set` parameter support
3. **Sync State** - Add KV persistence for cursor/progress tracking

**Phase 2: Advanced Features**  
4. **Albums Index** - Update main `albums/metadata.json` index
5. **Rate Limiting** - Enhanced budget tracking
6. **Error Handling** - Better error collection and reporting

**Phase 3: Migration**
7. **Testing** - Verify enhanced sync-fresh.ts works reliably  
8. **Evaluation** - Compare against sync-metadata.ts functionality
9. **Potential Replacement** - Consider deprecating sync-metadata.ts once feature-complete

**Current File Status:**
- `sync-fresh.ts` (64 lines) - Clean foundation, needs enhancement
- `sync-metadata.ts` (373 lines) - Complex but has useful patterns to extract  
- `sync-renditions.ts` - Focused rendition downloads, keep as-is
